# Hangman
Description
It's quite straightforeward, this is an unfinished hangman game made by me

type SAVE to save a game
type LOAD to load a game
type HINT to get a hint
type EXIT to exit

Problems:
  Should've added some comments
  Load doesn't work yet
  Game doesn't recognize when you've correctly guess all of the words
  HINT should display something like "You can't get more hints" if the number of your hints_left is 0
  It is possible to access the save files to view the correct word for the Hangman problem
  The code in the functions is more verbose than should be, partly because I didn't have internet connection for a while
  
Things I might add/change if I decide to continue this project:
  Turn it into a Rails app
  Show hangman
